Thanks for visiting my personal website. It's been a long time since I've updated this. The old version was a very scrapped-together hand-coded static site that was hosted for free on the Berkeley OCF servers. I was too cheap to even buy a [domain](j.mp/ricefield) for it. Ah, college.

Well, domains are cheap, Jekyll is way better than hand-writing all your HTML, and GitHub Pages is a great hosting option, so here we are. Looks a lot better than the previous one. Big thanks to [thephuse](https://github.com/thephuse) for the free theme, [Strange Case](https://github.com/thephuse/strange_case).

Feel free to take a look around. If you want to reach out, email is the best: _jonathantien at gmail dot com_
